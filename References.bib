abstract="We describe a protocol for quantum oblivious transfer, utilizing faint pulses of polarized light, by which one of two mutually distrustful parties (``Alice'') transmits two one-bit messages in such a way that the other party (``Bob'') can choose which message he gets but cannot obtain information about both messages (he will learn his chosen bit's value with exponentially small error probability and may gain at most exponentially little information about the value of the other bit), and Alice will be entirely ignorant of which bit he received. Neither party can cheat (ie deviate from the protocol while appearing to follow it) in such a way as to obtain more information than what is given by the description of the protocol. Our protocol is easy to modify in order to implement the All-or-Nothing Disclosure of one out of two string messages, and it can be used to implement bit commitment and oblivious circuit evaluation without complexity-theoretic assumptions, in a way that remains secure even against cheaters that have unlimited computing power. Moreover, this protocol is practical in that it can be realized with available optoelectronic apparatus while being immune to any technologically feasible attack for the foreseeable future.",

    abstract="In 1982, Bennett and Brassard suggested a new way to provide privacy in long distance communications with security based on the correctness of the basic principles of quantum mechanics. The scheme allows two parties, Alice and Bob, sharing no secret information in the first place, to exchange messages that nobody else can figure out. The only requirement is a quantum channel and a normal phone line connecting the two parties. The fact that quantum mechanics provides unconditional secure communications is a remarkable result that cannot be achieved by classical techniques alone. Apart from secure communication, cryptography is also interested in tasks that aim at protecting one party against a potentially dishonest peer. This scenario, called secure twoparty computation, is usually modelled by a function f(xA,xB) where xA and xB are Alice's and Bob's secret input respectively. They would like to execute a protocol that produces z = f(xA,xB) to both parties without disclosing their secret input to the other party. The only information about a secret input that can be leaked toward the other party is what the output z itself discloses about it. Unlike secure communication, secure two-party computation does not assume that Alice and Bob are honest. One honest party's input should remain secret whatever the other party's behaviour. It is well-known that in order to find a protocol for secure two-party computation, one must have access to a secure bit commitment scheme. Unfortunately, in 1996 Mayers showed that no secure quantum bit commitment scheme exists. Similarly to the classical case (where trapdoor one-way functions are needed) quantum cryptography does not provide secure two-party computation for free. In this paper, we discuss the possibilities and limits of quantum cryptography for two-party computation. We describe the essential distinctions between classical and quantum cryptography in this scenario.",

With respect to computational security, we show that existing feasibility results carry over unchanged from the classical to the quantum world; a functionality is ``trivial'' (i.e., can be realized without setup) in the quantum world if and only if it is trivial in the classical world. The same holds with regard to functionalities that are complete (i.e., can be used to realize arbitrary other functionalities).",

abstract="We propose a general security definition for cryptographic quantum protocols that implement classical non-reactive two-party tasks. The definition is expressed in terms of simple quantum- information-theoretic conditions which must be satisfied by the protocol to be secure. The conditions are uniquely determined by the ideal functionality {\$}{\backslash}mathcal{\{}F{\}}{\$}defining the cryptographic task to be implemented. We then show the following composition result. If quantum protocols $\pi$1,...,$\pi$â securely implement ideal functionalities {\$}{\backslash}mathcal{\{}F{\}}{\_}1,{\backslash}ldots,{\backslash}mathcal{\{}F{\}}{\_}{\backslash}ell{\$}according to our security definition, then any purely classical two-party protocol, which makes sequential calls to {\$}{\backslash}mathcal{\{}F{\}}{\_}1,{\backslash}ldots,{\backslash}mathcal{\{}F{\}}{\_}{\backslash}ell{\$}, is equally secure as the protocol obtained by replacing the calls to {\$}{\backslash}mathcal{\{}F{\}}{\_}1,{\backslash}ldots,{\backslash}mathcal{\{}F{\}}{\_}{\backslash}ell{\$}with the respective quantum protocols $\pi$1,...,$\pi$â. Hence, our approach yields the minimal security requirements which are strong enough for the typical use of quantum protocols as subroutines within larger classical schemes. Finally, we show that recently proposed quantum protocols for secure identification and oblivious transfer in the bounded-quantum-storage model satisfy our security definition, and thus compose in the above sense.",

abstract="We consider two-party quantum protocols starting with a transmission of some random BB84 qubits followed by classical messages. We show a general ``compiler'' improving the security of such protocols: if the original protocol is secure against an ``almost honest'' adversary, then the compiled protocol is secure against an arbitrary computationally bounded (quantum) adversary. The compilation preserves the number of qubits sent and the number of rounds up to a constant factor. The compiler also preserves security in the bounded-quantum-storage model (BQSM), so if the original protocol was BQSM-secure, the compiled protocol can only be broken by an adversary who has large quantum memory and large computing power. This is in contrast to known BQSM-secure protocols, where security breaks down completely if the adversary has larger quantum memory than expected. We show how our technique can be applied to quantum identification and oblivious transfer protocols.",

Damg{\aa}rd et al. (FOCS '05, CRYPTO '07) showed how to securely implement bit commitment and oblivious transfer in the bounded-quantum-storage model, where the adversary is only allowed to store a limited number of qubits. However, their security definitions did only apply to the standalone setting, and it was not clear if their protocols could be composed. Indeed, we show that these protocols are not composable in our framework without a small refinement. We then prove the security of their randomized oblivious transfer protocol with our refinement. Secure implementations of oblivious transfer and bit commitment follow easily by a (classical) reduction to randomized oblivious transfer.",

Our protocol has an efficient simulator which is important if one wishes to compose our protocol with protocols that are only computationally secure.

A one-time program can be executed on a single input, whose value can be specified at run time. Other than the result of the computation on this input, nothing else about the program is leaked. Hence, a one-time program is like a black box function that may be evaluated once and then ``self destructs.'' This also extends to k-time programs, which are like black box functions that can be evaluated k times and then self destruct.",

abstract="The concept of oblivious transfer (O.T.) that was induced by Halpern and Rabin m] turned out to be a very useful tool in designing cryptographic protocols. The related notion of ``one-out-of-two oblivious transfer'' was proposed by Even, Goldreich and Lempel in [EGL] together with some applications. Some more applications of this protocol can be found in recent papers [BCR], [GMWj. So far, the two notions where believed to be closely related but not known to be equivalent. This paper presents a proof that these two notions are computationally equivalent.",

abstract="We study the problem of single database private information retrieval, and present a solution with only logarithmic server-side communication complexity and a solution with only logarithmic user-side communication complexity. Previously the best result could only achieve polylogarithmic communication on each side, and was based on certain less well-studied assumptions in number theory [6]. On the contrary, our schemes are based on Paillier's cryptosystem [16], which along with its variants have drawn extensive studies in recent cryptographic researches [3, 4, 8, 9], and have many important applications [7, 8].",

abstract="This paper describes a 1-out-of-N oblivious transfer (OT) extension protocol with active security, which achieves very low overhead on top of the passively secure protocol of Kolesnikov and Kumaresan (Crypto 2011). Our protocol obtains active security using a consistency check which requires only simple computation and has a communication overhead that is independent of the total number of OTs to be produced. We prove its security in both the random oracle model and the standard model, assuming a variant of correlation robustness. We describe an implementation, which demonstrates our protocol only costs around 5--30{\%} more than the passively secure protocol.",

We propose a simple quantum secure direct communication protocol based on single-photon Bell-state measurement and remove side-channel attacks on photon detectors. This quantum communication protocol in principle works in a deterministic way, and it does not require the two-photon interference of photons from independent sources. The single-photon Bell-state measurement with a unity efficiency can be constructed with only linear optics, which significantly simplifies its experimental implementation. Furthermore, we prove that our quantum secure direct communication protocol is immune to general detector-side-channel attacks.}

In this article, we propose a one-step QSDC protocol, which only requires to distribute polarization-spatial-mode hyperentanglement for one round. In this QSDC protocol, the eavesdropper cannot obtain any message, so that this protocol is unconditionally secure in principle. This protocol is a two-way quantum communication and has high capacity for it can transmit two bits of secret messages with one pair of hyperentanglement. With entanglement fidelities of both polarization and spatial-mode degrees of freedom being 0.98, the maximal communication distance of this one-step QSDC can reach about 216Â km. QSDC can also be used to generate the key. In this regard, the key generation rate is estimated about 2.5 times of that in the entanglement-based QKD with the communication distance of 150Â km. With the help of future quantum repeaters, this QSDC protocol can provide unconditionally secure communication over arbitrarily long distance.}

    abstract = { Consider a data holder, such as a hospital or a bank, that has a privately held collection of person-specific, field structured data. Suppose the data holder wants to share a version of the data with researchers. How can a data holder release a version of its private data with scientific guarantees that the individuals who are the subjects of the data cannot be re-identified while the data remain practically useful? The solution provided in this paper includes a formal protection model named k-anonymity and a set of accompanying policies for deployment. A release provides k-anonymity protection if the information for each person contained in the release cannot be distinguished from at least k-1 individuals whose information also appears in the release. This paper also examines re-identification attacks that can be realized on releases that adhere to k-anonymity unless accompanying policies are respected. The k-anonymity protection model is important because it forms the basis on which the real-world systems known as Datafly, ÎŒ-Argus and k-Similar provide guarantees of privacy protection. }
