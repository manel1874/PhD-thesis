\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Acknowledgements}

The research presented in this dissertation was carried out under the supervision of Paulo Mateus and Armando Nolasco Pinto. I would like to thank them for their encouragement and support throughout these years.

I have benefited a lot from the stimulating discussions with my colleagues. In particular, I wish to extend my special thanks to Chrysoula Vlachou. Also, I would like to thank Pedro Branco for the discussions we had around the UC framework and other crypto-related topics. Without those, this journey would have been more arduous.

Also, I want to thank my friends Francisco Gomes, Gonçalo Santos, José Reis and Tomás Lobão. Ver\ae\ amiciti\ae\ sempitern\ae\ sunt. Finally and most importantly, I would like to thank my family for their love and support. This dissertation is dedicated to my wife Teresinha and my kids Henrique and Helena.
