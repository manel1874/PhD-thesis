The field of data mining and data analysis has seen significant advancements with the increasing power of computers \cite{Wang11}. However, the need for large-scale data collection can lead to the compromise of sensitive and private information, particularly in fields such as genomics \cite{NS08, L02, Homer08, Gymrek13}. As a result, the aggregation of data from different sources is often restricted by laws and regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) \cite{EUdataregulations2016}. While these regulations aim to protect individuals' privacy, they also limit the ability of honest parties to access the data needed to address important societal issues.

\section*{Secure multiparty computation}


To address the privacy concerns outlined above, various privacy-enhancing technologies have been proposed, such as secure multiparty computation (SMC) \cite{Li2016, Armknecht2015, Yao82}. SMC enables a group of $n$ parties, denoted as $P_i$, to jointly compute a function $f( x_1, ..., x_n ) = (y_1, ..., y_n)$ without revealing their inputs to the other parties. The security requirements of SMC are equivalent to an ideal scenario, where each party $P_i$ sends their inputs to a separate, trusted third party, who then computes $f()$ and returns the corresponding output to each party.

The research area of SMC has been greatly advanced with the development of various protocols and frameworks \cite{Goldreich87, Bendlin11, D12}. These protocols can be broadly classified into two categories: those based on Boolean logic and those based on arithmetic logic. The efficiency and security of SMC protocols rely heavily on the efficiency and security of important cryptographic primitives, such as oblivious transfer (OT) for Boolean-based protocols and oblivious linear evaluation (OLE) for arithmetic-based protocols. However, a fundamental limitation of these primitives is their reliance on public cryptography, as proven by Impagliazzo and Rudich \cite{IR99}. This dependence on public cryptography is a significant drawback in terms of both performance and security, as it requires more computational resources and is vulnerable to attacks from quantum computers, as demonstrated by Shor's algorithm \cite{Sho95}. To address these issues and ensure the safe deployment of SMC methods in the face of quantum computing, it is crucial to develop SMC methods that are secure against quantum attacks while maintaining state-of-the-art performance levels.


\section*{A quantum era}

The second quantum revolution is upon us and quantum technology has advanced to a point where we can integrate its unique features into complex engineering systems. Quantum cryptography, in particular, has been a major area of focus, with research aiming to develop protocols that offer advantages over their classical counterparts. As outlined in \cite{B15, PSAN13}, these advantages can take two forms:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Improving security requirements and achieving information-theoretically secure protocols or those that require fewer computational assumptions;
\item Developing new cryptographic primitives that were previously unattainable using classical techniques.
\end{enumerate}
While quantum key distribution (QKD) is the most well-known application of quantum cryptography, other cryptographic tasks such as bit commitment \cite{CK11}, coin flipping \cite{CK09}, delegated quantum computation \cite{BFK09}, position verification \cite{Unr14}, and password-based identification \cite{DFSS14, DFLSS09} also play important roles in this field.

Also, the intrinsic randomness provided by quantum phenomena is an ideal resource to develop quantum communication protocols for oblivious transfer (OT) \cite{BBCS92}. Remarkably, there is a distinctive difference between classical and quantum OT from a security standpoint, as the latter is proved to be possible assuming only the existence of quantum-hard one-way functions \cite{GLSV21, BCKM21}. This means quantum OT can be based only on symmetric cryptography, requiring weaker security assumptions than classical OT. Moreover, these quantum protocols frequently have a desirable property that guarantees information-theoretic security after the execution of the protocol. This property is commonly called everlasting security. This greatly improves the security of SMC protocols, allowing them to have their security based on symmetric cryptography alone and with this important feature of everlasting security. Regarding oblivious linear evaluation (OLE) primitive, it is known that it can be reduced to OT \cite{KOS16} through classical methods that do not require further assumptions. Therefore, it seems natural to use quantum OT to generate quantum-secure OLE instances.


\section*{Contributions and outline} %Section - 1.2

Despite the many advances, the adoption of quantum cryptography by secure multiparty computation (SMC) systems is still reduced. This is due to the efficiency challenges imposed by quantum technology and the need of high throughput of both OT and OLE primitives in boolean- and arithmetic-based SMC, respectively.

The overall goal of this dissertation is to give one step closer to the adoption of quantum cryptography by SMC systems. We do this with three contributions. In our first contribution, we start the studying of comparing the efficiency of both classical and quantum protocols. Our second contribution is an implementation of a special-purpose SMC system applied to genomics analysis assisted with quantum OT. Our last contribution is the first quantum OLE protocol which does not rely on OT. Along the way, we produced a review dedicated to quantum OT protocols alone. Usually, its analysis is integrated into more general surveys under the topic of “quantum cryptography”, leading to a less in-depth exposition of the topic.

We describe the contributions in a bit more detail.

\

\noindent\textbf{Efficiency of classical and quantum OT protocols.} To the best of our knowledge, there is no comparative study on the efficiency of quantum and classical approaches. This is mainly caused by two reasons. From a theoretical perspective, the use of different types of information (quantum and classical) makes it difficult to make a fair comparison based on the protocols' complexity. Also, from a practical standpoint, there is still a discrepancy in the technological maturity between quantum and classical techniques. Quantum technology is still in its infancy,  whereas classical processors and communication have many decades of development. 

Despite these constraints, we compare the complexity and operations efficiency of classical and quantum protocols. To achieve this, we realize that both classical and quantum protocols can be divided into two phases: precomputation and transfer phase. The precomputation phase is characterize by the fact that it is independent of the parties' inputs. This means that, from a practical point-of-view, this phase produces the resources necessary to use during the transfer phase, where we take into consideration the parties' inputs. It can be argued that the precomputation phase is not so hungry-efficient as the transfer phase. As a consequence, for comparison purposes, we can focus on the transfer phase. Fortunately, the transfer phase of quantum OT is solely based on classical communications. Therefore, it is possible and fair to compare the transfer phase of both classical and quantum protocols. 

We make a detailed comparison between the complexity of the transfer phase of two state-of-the-art classical OT protocols \cite{ALSZ13, KOS15} and an optimised quantum OT protocol. We conclude that the transfer phase of quantum OT competes with its classical counterparts and has the potential to be more efficient.

\

\noindent\textbf{Quantum oblivious linear evaluation protocol.} Our second contribution is a quantum protocol for OLE with quantum universally composable (quantum-UC) security in the $\mathcal{F}_{\textbf{COM}}-$hybrid model, i.e. when assuming the existence of a commitment functionality, $\mathcal{F}_{\textbf{COM}}$. To obtain a secure protocol, we take advantage of the properties of Mutually Unbiased Bases in high-dimensional Hilbert spaces with prime and prime-power dimension. Such a choice is motivated by recent theoretical and experimental advances that pave the way for the development and realization of new solutions for quantum cryptography \cite{BPT00,DEBZ10,Zhongetal2015,BHVBFHM18,DHMPPV21}. 

To the best of our knowledge our protocol is the first quantum-UC secure quantum OLE proposal. Moreover, it is not based on any quantum OT implementation which would be the standard approach. %Instead, we only assume the existence of a commitment functionality that seems to be a simpler task than OT, as argued in \cite{Unruh10}.
We consider the static corruption adversarial model with both semi-honest and malicious adversaries. We develop a weaker version of OLE, which may be of independent interest. We also modify the proposed protocol to generate quantum-UC secure vector OLE (VOLE). We give bounds on the possible size of VOLE according to the security parameters.

\

\noindent\textbf{Quantum assisted secure multiparty computation.} Individuals’ privacy and legal regulations demand genomic data be handled and studied with highly secure privacy-preserving techniques. In this contribution, we propose a feasible secure multiparty computation (SMC) system assisted with quantum cryptographic protocols that is designed to compute a phylogenetic tree from a set of private genome sequences. This system adapts several distance-based methods (Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic mean, Neighbour-Joining, Fitch-Margoliash) into a private setting where the sequences owned by each party are not disclosed to the other members present in the protocol. We do not apply a generic implementation of SMC to the problem of phylogenetic trees. Instead, we develop a tailored private protocol for this use case in order to improve efficiency. 

We theoretically evaluate the performance and privacy guarantees of the system through a complexity analysis and security proof and give an extensive explanation about the implementation details and cryptographic protocols. We also implement a quantum-assisted secure phylogenetic tree computation based on the Libscapi implementation of the Yao protocol, the PHYLIP library and simulated keys of two quantum systems: quantum oblivious key distribution and quantum key distribution.\footnote{ The code can be accessed at the following repo: \href{https://github.com/manel1874/private-phylogenetic-analysis}{https://github.com/manel1874/private-phylogenetic-analysis}}. This demonstrates its effectiveness and practicality. We benchmark our implementation against a classical-only solution and we conclude that both approaches render similar execution times. The only difference between the quantum and classical systems is the time overhead taken by the oblivious key management system of the quantum-assisted approach.

\

The results are presented as follows. We start presenting the technical elements required throughout the thesis. Chapter~\ref{chapter_QOT} is devoted to quantum oblivious transfer protocols. Then, in Chapter~\ref{classical-and-quantum-OT} we compare classical and quantum approaches for OT. In Chapter~\ref{ch:phylogenetic-trees}, we presented our implementation of quantum-assisted SMC system applied to phylogeny analysis. In Chapter~\ref{ch:QOLE}, we present our quantum OLE protocol along with its security proof. Finally, in Chapter~\ref{ch:conclusion} we present an overall conclusion of the thesis and propose some future work.
